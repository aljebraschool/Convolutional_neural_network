# Convolutional_neural_network

### This convolutional neural network was developed using the CIFAR-10 dataset to meet the prerequisites of the Udacity Introduction to Deep Learning Nanodegree program.

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) emerges as a prevailing powerhouse in the domain of deep learning, particularly in the realm of image classification. In comparison to the conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), the CNNs stand out by excelling at capturing intricate spatial intricacies embedded within images. This distinct architecture equips CNNs to adeptly handle extensive datasets and navigate intricate attributes, positioning them as the optimal choice for tasks such as image recognition and object detection.

In the scope of this project, I embarked on training a CNN model, leveraging the formidable [CIFAR-10 database](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), to proficiently identify and categorize images. This dataset comprises diverse classes including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
